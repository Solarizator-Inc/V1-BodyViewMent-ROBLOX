# BodyViewMent [V2]
This is the new, reworked BodyViewMent! BodyViewMent [V1](https://create.roblox.com/store/asset/89662365987335) is considered *deprecated* and should ***NOT*** be used in new work.
# About the V2 BodyViewMent
BodyViewMent V2 fixes a bug that was found within V1, which is that the camera glitches when close to the head. This is because V1 used
(game.Workspace.CurrentCamera.CFrame.Position - head.Position).Magnitude <= 2.5
which is inefficient. Sadly, no more head movement, but camera offset is still added. No known bugs were found, however if there is, issue the error.
# How to get
Go to the [Creator Store](https://create.roblox.com/store/asset/91510699816696) or download the [ZIP file](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/19275286/BodyViewMent.V2.zip).
# How to setup
If you bought the model with Creator Store, go into Roblox Studio, go to the experience you want to set this up at, go to the Toolbox, press Inventory (second button), and [V2] BodyViewMent must be the very first thing. Drag it into the experience, or click the V2 BodyViewMent. There should be a confirmation screen or not. If there is, click OK. There should be a folder named: ***Ungroup and put scripts in designated services.*** Open the folder, and there should be 2 *local* scripts, ***StarterGUI***, and ***StarterPlayer > StarterCharacterScripts***. Place them in their said positions.

If you bought the model as a ZIP file, go to your Downloads, unzip the file, and drag the RBXM to the place you want to add it to. There should be a confirmation screen or not. If there is, click OK. There should be a folder named: ***Ungroup and put scripts in designated services.*** Open the folder, and there should be 2 *local* scripts, ***StarterGUI***, and ***StarterPlayer > StarterCharacterScripts***. Place them in their said positions.

If done, have fun with it!
