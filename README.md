# About BodyViewMent and Known Bugs

BodyViewMent scripts are for the first person body viewmodel and head movement. It is like real life, however with some known bugs.

1. Camera glitches when close to head. This is because it uses
```
(game.Workspace.CurrentCamera.CFrame.Position - head.Position).Magnitude <= 2.5
```
which has some bugs in it.

No other bugs are recorded, however reply to this post in order for me to check towards it.
